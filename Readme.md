# Geraldson's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase my passion and skills in the world of software development. This project is crafted using Blazor, a fantastic web framework that lets me express my creativity using C# and HTML, and spiced up with Tailwind CSS, a powerful utility-first CSS framework for crafting sleek user interfaces.

## Technologies in Action

- **Blazor:** Crafting interactive web UIs with the elegance of C# instead of the usual JavaScript hustle.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling the application to make it not only functional but also visually appealing. Tailwind CSS gives me the flexibility to design unique interfaces tailored to my liking.

## Features
